# 🧠 Investor Behavior Analysis – EDA Project

## 📊 Overview
This project explores the **behavior and profiles of investors** based on a dataset of 40 individuals. It uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visualizations** to answer questions like:

    •	What are their preferred investment avenues?

    •	How long do they plan to invest?

    •	What profitability do they expect?

    •	How frequently do they monitor their 
    investments?

The analysis provides insights useful for both **personal finance decision-making** and professionals in the **financial industry**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

    •	Understand investor behavior across different age groups and genders.

    •	Identify common patterns in investment periods, expected returns, and avenues.

    •	Categorize investors by strategy: conservative, aggressive, etc.

    •	Visualize data to reveal trends using Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

    •	Python (Pandas, NumPy)
    •	Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    •	Jupyter Notebook
